      <p>This site will hopefully get prettier when I learn more about how to make it that way. 
         I like the idea of a blog to track the changes in the site as a result of changes in myself.
         I'm learning that I like front-end development more than back-end, but I would like to learn both.
         Working on this now, I'm seeing just how vast the world of front-end development is. 
         I took web development a couple of years ago and I loved it!
         I'll try to learn more web dev skills during winter break, which is only a few days away!
         That's it for now.
