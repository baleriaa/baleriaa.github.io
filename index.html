      <h1>Baleria Reyes' Portfolio Site</h1>
      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name's Baleria and I'm a software engineering student at Oregon State University. I'd like to build software that matters.
         I'm currently a part of a team of students working with an organization that's dedicated to educating youth about the environment 
         through a gamiified educational app called Earthwin. More information about the organization <a href="https://earthwin.org/">here</a>.

      <h3>12/2/2022</h3>
      <p>This site will hopefully get prettier when I learn more about how to make it that way. 
         I like the idea of a blog to track the changes in the site as a result of changes in myself.
         I'm learning that I like front-end development more than back-end, but I would like to learn both.
         Working on this now, I'm seeing just how vast the world of front-end development is. 
         I took web development a couple of years ago and I loved it!
         I'll try to learn more web dev skills during winter break, which is only a few days away!
         That's it for now.
      </p>
